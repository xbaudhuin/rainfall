decompile ./bonus1

nb = atoi(av[1]) should be number < 9
and nb final value should be: 1464814662 = 0x574f4c46
the goal is to use the memcpy to change the value of nb
there is a buffer of 40 chars before nb on the stack


memcpy take nb *4 as size:
we can underflow nb *4 so when it is converted to unsigned int it will = 44
44 for the size of buff + 4

2 possible value according to our small program
so the payload will be:
av[1] = "value"
av[2] = 40 chars as paddings + "\x46\x4c\x4f\x57" (bytes value)
