decompile ./level8

commands are:
- "auth "   => allocate variable auth
- "reset"   => free auth
- "service" => strdup(str)
- "login"   => if (int *)(auth + 8) != 0 system("/bin/sh") 

auth is on the heap so the goal is to make auth + 8 != 0
- we allocate auth via "auth " to make it on the heap
- we use "service" and overflow the input buffer to allocate with the strdup(str)
- login
