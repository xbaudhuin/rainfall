decompile ./level3

program use fgets which is safe
printf directly the buffer of gets which is unsafe: Format string attack

the program compare a global variable m with 64

the goal is to write into the variable m the value 64 by formating the buffer with %n
%n write the number of bytes currently write by printf into the variable given
$ is used to the the nth element of the stack

we first write the adress of the variable m (got it with gdb) to put it on the stack
then we write 60 characters
that makes it 64 characters total!
then we get the number of argument on the stock of our adress with: "4444 %1$n %2$n ..."
                                                                    value to look for + %(n-th element)$n 

here its the 4th
so our payload is : adress of m + %60c + %4$n
%60c to write 60 + adress of m = 64 char into the 4th element of the stack which is the beginning of this buffer

python -c 'import struct; print struct.pack("<I", 0x804988c) + "%60c%4$n' > /tmp/lvl3
