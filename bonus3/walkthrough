decompile ./bonus3

the program read 66 chars of the file .pass into a zero'ed buffer
then it puts a '\0' in the 65e char in the buffer
then it puts a '\0' in the atoi(av[1]) char in the buffer

it then read the end of the file .pass
and then strcmp buffer and av[1]

the main vulnerability is that atoi("") return 0
so if put an empty string av[1] 
strcmp will compare buffer[0] = '\0'
	       with av[1][0]  = '\0'
	and will return 0
so the execve will be the following instruction

=> ./bonus3 ""
